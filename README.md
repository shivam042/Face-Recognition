# Face-Recognition
This application is capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source.

Used the k-nearest-neighbors(knn) algorithm and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) for face recognition.
It is based on the geometric features of a face

This application can be used when we wish to recognize a large set of known people,
and make a prediction for an unkown person in feasible computation time.
